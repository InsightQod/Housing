Description: This assignment is the first deliverable for the End-to-End Machine Learning Capstone Project. Teams are required to submit a detailed one-page project proposal outlining their chosen dataset, project goals, and preliminary approach. This proposal is crucial for setting the direction of your project and ensuring you have a solid foundation before diving into the practical aspects of machine learning.

Objectives:

Identify and articulate the problem you aim to solve with your chosen dataset.
Demonstrate the relevance and potential impact of your project.
Outline your initial approach and methodology.
Instructions:

Team Information: Begin with a brief section introducing your team members.
Dataset Selection: Describe the dataset you have chosen, including its source, size, and any relevant features. Explain why this dataset is suitable for your project.
Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem you are addressing. What are the key questions or challenges your project will tackle?
Goals and Objectives: Articulate the specific goals of your project. What do you aim to achieve or demonstrate with your analysis?
Preliminary Approach: Provide an overview of your planned approach. This might include potential algorithms, tools, or methods you anticipate using.
Formatting and Submission Guidelines:

Your proposal should be no more than one page in length.
Use a clear, readable font (e.g., Arial or Times New Roman) in size 12.
Margins should be set to 1 inch on all sides.
Submit your proposal in PDF or Microsoft Word format to ensure formatting is preserved.
Name your file as follows: [TeamName]_ProjectProposal.pdf
Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and coherence of the problem statement and objectives.
Relevance and appropriateness of the chosen dataset.
Thoughtfulness of the preliminary approach.
Overall organization and presentation of the proposal.
Deadline:

Sunday, Dec 10, at 11:59 PM. Late submissions will not be accepted.
